# Software Design

Domain Driven Design
The code classes should reflect real world objects for that domain. That is, each class should have a real world counterpart.

## Principles

 - Separation of Concerns
 
 - You aren't gonna need it (YAGNI)

 - Law of Demeter (Principle of least knowledge)
 
 - Don't repeat yourself (DRY)
 
 - Conway's Law
 
 - Levels of Abstraction
 
 - Consistency

### SOLID

 - Single Responsibility Principle

   There is a second question, as important as "does every class have only one reason to change?" and that is "does every change only affect one class?"
 
 - Open / Closed Principle
 
 - Liskov Substitution Principle
 
 - Interface Segregation Principle
 
 - Dependency Inversion Principle

## Patterns
