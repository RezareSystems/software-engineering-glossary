# Variables

This section explains different types of variable concepts.

## Explanatory Variable
This is a term used by Robert C. Martin who describes an explanatory variable as a variable whose only purpose is to explain what its contents are.

An example would be: `var isPositive = someVariable > 0;`, were `isPositive` explains what `someVariable > 0` means.
